## About
Roverfy is a web framework inspired by Django but built in Rust. Its main purpose is to simplify web development with features like server-side rendering and an emphasis on simplicity and performance. It is designed to be a complete, easy-to-use framework that provides the necessary tools for building robust, high-performance web applications.

Main Objectives:
Server-side rendering (SSR).

Django-inspired structure, providing a familiar framework for Python developers.

Easy to use, with minimal configuration required, perfect for both novice and experienced developers.

High performance, leveraging Rust's efficiency.

Soon, Roverfy will be available on Cargo, making it easy to integrate into your Rust projects.

## Features
Server-side rendering (SSR): Allows pages to be generated on the server before being sent to the client, improving SEO and performance.

Django-inspired: If you're familiar with Django, you'll feel right at home. Roverfy follows a similar structure and philosophy.

Scalable and efficient: Leveraging Rust’s performance, Roverfy is designed to handle large, complex applications.

Easy to use: With minimal setup, you can start building your web application in no time.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and start using Roverfy in your project.

Prerequisites
Rust: You need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can install it from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

Steps:
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roverfy.git
cd roverfy
```
Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```
Run the server to see Roverfy in action:

```bash
cargo run
```
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to see the application running.

Note: The library will soon be available on Cargo, making integration even easier for your projects.

## Usage
Roverfy is designed to be easy to use. Here are the basic steps to get started:

Set up your application following a structure similar to Django.

Define your routes and views, taking advantage of the server-side rendering system.

Use the integrated tools for database management, sessions, and authentication (if needed).

Once Roverfy is available on Cargo, you’ll only need to include it in your Cargo.toml file to start building your web application.

## Technologies
Roverfy is built with the following technologies:

Rust: The base language, ensuring high performance and safety.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Improves SEO and performance by generating views on the server.

Future integration with Cargo: It will be available as a library on Cargo to simplify integration.
